            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream (optional, for extra creaminess)</li>

        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cook the Pasta</strong>: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the Roux</strong>: In a large skillet or saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant. Stir in the flour and cook for another 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, to create a roux.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the Milk</strong>: Gradually whisk in the milk and cream (if using) to the roux. Continue to whisk until the mixture is smooth and begins to thicken.</li>
            <li><strong>Incorporate the Cheese</strong>: Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese, and continue to cook until the cheese is melted and the sauce is smooth. Season with salt, pepper, and dried Italian herbs if using.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine with Pasta</strong>: Add the cooked pasta to the sauce, tossing to coat the pasta evenly. If adding cooked chicken or vegetables, stir them in at this stage.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve</strong>: Serve the white sauce pasta immediately, garnished with additional Parmesan cheese and freshly ground black pepper if desired. Enjoy your creamy and comforting meal!</li>
